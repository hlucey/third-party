# Getting started tutorial
{: #get-started}

In this tutorial, we introduce the IBM Provider workbench and walk through the process of registering your third-party offering as an integrated billing service.
{:shortdesc}

You can deliver a third-party offering in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} either as an integrated billing service or a referral service. This tutorial focuses on the integrated billing service option. To learn more about the referral service option, see [Third-party offering types](/docs/third-party/offering-types.html).
{: tip}

## Step 1. Register your offering
{: #step1}

Register your offering in the [Provider workbench](https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/workbench/){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon").

1. From the Provider workbench details page, click **Onboard a new offering**, and complete the registration form.
2. Check your inbox for an email that confirms your registration.

## Step 2. List your offering type
{: #step2}

Use the Provider workbench to list your offering type as an integrated billing service.

1. From the [Provider workbench dashboard](https://www.ibm.com/marketplace/workbench/provider/dashboard){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon"), click **Tasks** on your offering tile.
2. Select **{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} listing tasks** from the **Filter** menu to filter for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} tasks only.
3. Click **Start** in the Content task tile, and complete the readiness assessment form. Answer the last question by selecting **Integrated billing service** as the offering type.

## Step 3. Define your offering details
{: #step3}

After you select **Integrated billing service** as your offering type and submit the readiness assessment form, the page is refreshed with a section for defining the content. It's displayed on your catalog details page in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. Complete each field and submit the form for review. The review process can take a few days.

## Next steps
{: #next-steps}

When you're approved, you receive an email that outlines your next steps:

* In the Provider workbench, you create your getting started documentation and marketing content.

  The email includes the link to where your getting started documentation is published. Save the URL, because you use it as you're working in the resource management console. 
  {: tip}

* In the resource management console, integrate your offering into {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} by defining your offering, building pricing plans, enabling security, and managing the deployment of your offering in different {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} environments.
